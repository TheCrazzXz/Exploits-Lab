# EXPLOITS
## STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW FOR SHELLCODE INJECTION AND EXECUTION
## REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND : Stack buffer overflow to overwrite registers backups especially to redirect code execution
## Doesn't work if : NX is enabled
## Bypasses protection : Umm, no protection
Okay, how to execute shellcode from a program
We could just place the shellcode in a buffer then jump to the buffer
