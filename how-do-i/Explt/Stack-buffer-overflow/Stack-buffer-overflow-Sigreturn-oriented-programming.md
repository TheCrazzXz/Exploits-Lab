# EXPLOITS
## STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW FOR RETURN ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (ROP)
## REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND : Stack buffer overflow to overwrite registers backups especially to redirect code execution
## Can't work if : 
```
> PIE (position independant executable) is enabled
```
## Bypasses protection :
```
> NX (non executable) because we're not executing any shellcode
> ASLR because we don't jump to any libc function
```
