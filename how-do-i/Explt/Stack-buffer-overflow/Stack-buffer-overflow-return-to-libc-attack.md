# EXPLOITS
## STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW FOR RETURN TO LIBC (ret2libc)
## REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND : Stack buffer overflow to overwrite registers backups especially to redirect code execution
## Can't work if : 
```
> ASLR is enabled (because if it's enabled, the address of the buffer will be randomized, then, unless we're really lucky, we won't be able to jump to the buffer because it's address is random, note that it's still possible to exploit even if it's enabled but really hard)
```
## Bypasses protection : 
```
> NX (non executable) because we're not executing any shellcode
```
