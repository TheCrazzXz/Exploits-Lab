# Blind RET2LIBC

This attack, that i call blind ret2libc, is an attack that will bypass ASLR, we're gonna leak the address of scanf() to get the address of the function execve() (not system because it contains a 0x20 which is the space character) then we can do a ret2libc using the leaked address 
Compile with :
```bash
gcc main.c -o <executable> -fno-stack-protector -m32
```
You can have ASLR on
