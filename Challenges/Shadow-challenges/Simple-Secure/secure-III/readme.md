# Format string vulnerability

This one is a **format string vulnerability**, it's a **memory leak vulnerability**, let me explain you how it works
## How does printf works 
`printf()` (for print format) takes infinite arguments, but the first argument is the **format**, like how do you wanna show your variables, to indicate the format of a variable to print,
you have to use a flag (`%s` (string), `%d` (decimal), `%x`, hexadecimal)
Okay so when you use `printf()`, you usualy use like this : 
```c
printf("Hello, %s, you are %d years old", user_name, user_age);
```
Considering that `user_age` = 19 and `user_name` = "Patrick" It will give us :
```
Hello Patrick, you are 19 years old
```
Let's have another example :
```c
printf("");
```
Okay but what happens if we don't give any of these arguments
