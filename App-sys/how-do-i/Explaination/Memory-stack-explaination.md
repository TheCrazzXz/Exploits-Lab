# EXPLAINATION
## MEMORY (stack) :
The memory is the place where all variables go, it can stock a lot of data, each variable has an address in the memory

The memory has a region which is the stack, the first variable will be placed at the very bottom of the stack, it will have the lowest address
		
Each time a variable is added to the stack of the memory, it is added over the upper element, and because of that, it's extensible
		
Example : 
```c
int var1 = 50
int var2 = 41
int var3 = 34
```
Stack in memory representation :
```
[-------------------]
Address	  | Value
---------------------
x+8       | 34 //var3
x+4       | 41 //var2
x+0       | 50 //var1
[-------------------]
```
You can see each time you add a variable the new address is the toppest one incremented by 4, but depending on the variable size, it could be more or less :
- An integer or unsigned integer reserves `4` bytes so it will increment the address by `4` in 32 bits and `8` in 64 bits
- A character reserves `1` byte (because ASCII is from `0` to `255` so one byte (8 bits)) so it will increment the address the address by `1`
- A structure will allocate the size of structure, including all the sizes of all the variables in it
When you create an array, you reserve multiple memory places (addresses)
Example : 
```c
char arr[] = "PWND"; // char arr[] = {"P", "W", "N", "D"}
```
			
Stack in memory representation :
```
[-------------------]
Address	  | Value
---------------------
x+12      | 'D' //arr[3]
x+8       | 'N' //arr[2]
x+4       | 'W' //arr[1]
x+0       | 'P' //arr[0]
[-------------------]
```
