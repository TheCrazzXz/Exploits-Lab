# C structured memory handle
## Simple variables
In C, when you allocate a variable, you have to set the variable type, but in memory, all data types are the same, however, what will differ is their size in bytes :
```
char : 1 byte (it's an ASCII number that goes from 0 to 255)
int : 4 bytes (it goes from 0 to 2**8*4 (2**32))
long (in 64 bits) : 8 bytes (it goes from 0 to 2**8*8 (2**64))
long (in 32 bits) : 4 bytes (it goes from 0 to 2**8*8 (2**64))
long long (in 64 bits) : 8 bytes (it goes from 0 to 2**8*8 (2**64))
long long (in 32 bits) : 8 bytes (it goes from 0 to 2**8*8 (2**64))
```
The `sizeof(<type>)` function in C will return the size of a type  
## Arrays
For arrays, it allocates the size of the type times the length of the array  
By the way :
- The length of an array represents how much of allocations of a type we want
- The size of an array represents the size of the type we want times the length of the array
So here are some examples :
```
Array of 16 chars has size of : 1*16 = 16 bytes
Array of 32 ints has size of : 4*32 = 128 bytes
Array of 64 longs (in 64 bits) has size of : 8*64 = 512 bytes
```
## Structures
The size of a struture gathers the size of all the variables which are allocated into it  
For example :
```c
struct <structure>
{
        int var1; // (+4) 4
        int var2; // (+4) 8
        long long var3; // (+8) 16
};
```
The size of this structure is the sum of the size of `var1` (4), `var2` (4) and `var3` (8) and it's `16`  
Let's have another example :
```c
struct <structure>
{
  int arr1[8]; // +(4*8 = 32) 32
  char arr2[16]; // +(1*16 = 16) 48
}
```
The size of this structure is the sum of the size of `arr1` (4 * 8 = 32) and `arr2` (1 * 16 = 16) and it's `48`
