# FILE structure exploitation
Let's say you can control a `FILE` structure, or when you can for example control the `FILE*` pointer or when you can write to a specific address, you can then corrupt what this pointer is pointing to, and you can then courrput some members of the `_IO_FILE` (`FILE`) structure to do what you wan't, that's `FILE` structure exploitation
