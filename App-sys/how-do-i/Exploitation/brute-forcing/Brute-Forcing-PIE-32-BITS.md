# Exploitation
## Brute forcing PIE In 32 bits
### Insight
For now everything we did was quite good, but most of the time every ROP we performed and else except partial address overwrite was based on the fact that PIE is always enabled.  
Let me tell you right now, in modern systems, PIE is almost omnipresent, and we have to find a way to go against it.  
We've already covered Partial Address Overwrite, and it works, but it has huge limitations :
- First if we're doing it from a buffer overflow which is coming from libc functions like `gets`, `scanf`, `strcpy` it may not work, unless there's a null byte after the bytes we overwrite in memory, because this functions would set null byte to the byte after our input.  
- Also, this works when we're doing a single address overwrite, but what if we're doing a Return Oriented Programming, we'll have to do this for every gadget, but the offset between these gadgets might be huge, so doing partial address overwrite won't work.  

We also saw a particular exploit when fork is used in a loop, and it works great, it can also defeat Stack Smashing Protection, but again, it is really a special case, not every program uses fork.  

So for this whole article, we'll be exploiting a 32 bits program, and in this article we won't see a magical technique on how to bypass PIE because the two techniques aforementionned are the only ones i know. But in the other hand, we'll take a look at what it takes to brute-force PIE randomness, what we'll apply in this article is extremely reasonnable, the brute force should be really quick and should take at most like 1 minute or really less, after like 16000 executions of the program, we should guess the correct thing at least one time.  

So, how do you really do ? Well first know that it's in 32 bits, it's not that it won't work in 64 bits but it's hugely easier in 32 bits, since there's less nibbles (4 bits) we'll have to guess.  

First let's see how **EXACTLY** PIE works, but let's first see in an abstract way.
