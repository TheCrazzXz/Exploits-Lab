## Pointer in the stack corruption
## REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND : Simple stack buffer overflow
## You should disable ASLR first : `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
In the stack, there is a lot more Interesting stuff that we could overwrite than the base pointer and the instruction pointer backups, when a program is loaded, there are many things that are loaded into it that it can use, such as program arguments, where the first one is the path + the name of the program, the environment variables... But those are pointers, thus they point to memory, but if we overwrite them with like `XXXX` the address where the pointer will point will be now `0x58585858`, and that's perfect, meaning that we can set this to any address that we want  
Here is an example where the program will print the program name, in we use it as `argv[0]` :
```
#include <stdio.h>

const char* secret = "4m_1_sUpp0sed_t0_b3_a_fl4g_0r_4nyth1ng_?";

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char buffer[64];
	gets(buffer);
	printf("Program name : %s\n", argv[0]);
}
```
Here, the program will print the program name, but if we somehow corrupt the pointer `argv[0]` to make it point to for example the `secret` variable, it will print this variable, so it's an information leakage, but how can we corrupt it ?... 
Of course with a buffer overflow based on a buffer of 64 bytes (characters)  
So we first need to find the offset between the `buffer` and `argv[0]`  
It's a hassle to find the `argv` pointer address is gdb i will just print it :
```c
#include <stdio.h>

const char* secret = "Try to pwn me please";

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char buffer[64];
	gets(buffer);
	printf("Program name : %s\n", argv[0]);

	printf("Buffer addr : %p\n", &buffer);
	printf("argv addr : %p\n", &argv);
}
```
That's what we need, notice i used `&` for each one because we don't want to know where is pointer pointing into but directly the address of the pointer  
This is what it gived me (may differ for you) :
```
./vuln
<(entry)>
Program name : ./vuln
Buffer addr : 0xffffd0e0
argv addr : 0xffffd154
```
We can see that the address of the `buffer` is `0xffffd0e0` and the address of `argv` is `0xffffd154`, so to get the offset between them, we, of couse, want to substract `argv` from `argv` : `0xffffd154`-`0xffffd0e0`
