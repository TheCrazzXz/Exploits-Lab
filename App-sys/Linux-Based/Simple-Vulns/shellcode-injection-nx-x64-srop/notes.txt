IN this exploit, i can make the stack executable again at the program runtime using mprotect

I did 2 things for this exploit :
	- In s2 i used the syscall mprotect, but the thing is that it's really hard to set RAX to 10 (0x0A) because 10 is a "\n" in ASCII so gets stops at it, it's possible using gadgets but i couldn't so i added a `mov rax, 0x0A ; ret` gadget
	- In s3 i've directly used the function mprotect from libx, which not require RAX to be set, and it works, the problem is that, for further exploitation, i would like to use this technique bypassing ASLR so it's harder
