This exploit is pretty funny, it should print "P0WNED!! LOL" to the screen
I don't know why but i when i add \x0A (next line) to the string to print it gives me a segmentation fault
Then it exists the program with the code 0xdeadbeef

I added some gadgets in the print() function because i didn't find them in the c libraries
